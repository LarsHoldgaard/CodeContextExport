# CodeContextExport
CodeContextExport is a lightweight WinForms application designed to streamline the process of exporting file contents from development projects into a structured .txt file for LLM's such as Claude / ChatGPT. This tool enables users to easily select files or folders from their projects and consolidate the content into a single text output. It's especially useful for preparing files for Large Language Models (LLMs) that require project context, making it easier to upload code and relevant data for tools like AI-based code assistants.

Why It's Cool & Important:
CodeContextExport takes the hassle out of manually gathering and copying file content by automating the export process. Whether you're working with AI-driven tools that need a better understanding of your codebase or just want an efficient way to extract file content, this tool saves time and simplifies workflows.

(Lol, all written by ChatGPT - pretty bad, right?)


PS: No human has read this code, and it was made very quickly. I don't mind shit code, but even I don't dare open these files.
